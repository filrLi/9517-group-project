# 9517-group-project

#### Division works:

1.  Task1: Zitong Li, Javan
2.  Task2: Yang Cao
3.  Task3: Yang Yu, Yijin Zheng

**Group Component - 30 marks
** The group Component **consists of 3 tasks**, each of which needs to be **completed as a group and will be evaluated ONCE for the whole group**.

*Data:* For this component you are provided a sequence of images (extracted from a video) from The Eleventh IEEE International Workshop on Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance (PETS 2009) [2] in **Project_Data -> Group_Component**.

*Task 1:*

In this task you will implement a Python solution to detect and track all the pedestrian movements within the video (image sequence) frames. You will have to:

1.  a)  detect all the moving pedestrians and draw a bounding box around each of them

2.  b)  draw the trajectory (track / path) of each moving pedestrian

3.  c)  print (as an output to the terminal, or directly on the image sequence / video) the real-

    time count of all the moving pedestrians detected since start of the video frame 1.

Task 2:
 You should allow the user to draw a rectangular bounding box within the whole window (hint: use OpenCV to draw) on the first frame / image. Then print (as output to the terminal, or print on the image sequence / video) the real-time counts of:

1.  a)  pedestrians who enter the bounding box
2.  b)  pedestrians who move out of the bounding box

Task 3:
 In this task you will implement functions to enable group behaviour recognition. By analysing the image sequence (video) you should:

1.  a)  provide real-time information on how many pedestrians walk in groups (of more than 1 person), and how many pedestrians walk alone
2.  b)  detect and show (using a bounding box or other means of pointing) occurrences of group formation (eg. two people meet and stay together for more than one frame, two people meet up and walk together, etc) and group destruction (when members in a group split).

**Deliverables for Group Component:**

During the scheduled lecture and lab hours in week 10 (Wednesday Apr 22nd and Friday Apr 24th), each group will make a 15-minute demo/presentation to one tutor and one assessor. This should include a short slide show presentation (5 slides maximum) explaining your methods and evaluation, followed by a demonstration of your implementation. Finally, you will answer questions from the assessors/audience. The tutor and assessor will provide feedback during this session. All group members should be present for this demo. The demo schedule will be released closer to the deadline.

**Note: Given the migration of all teaching related activities online, the demo/presentation is also likely to be held online, as also the question/answer session and feedback from assessors. In that case, all group members will be expected to present online and participate in the proceedings. More detailed instructions will be provided closer to the demo/presentation dates.**

Each group will also submit a report of maximum 10 pages (2-column IEEE format) along with the source code(s) by Apr 24th, Friday week 10. The report should include the following parts:

1.  1)  Introduction- discuss on your understanding of the task specification and data sets

2.  2)  Literature Review- review of relevant techniques in literature, along with any necessary

    background to understand the techniques you selected.

3.  3)  Method (implementation)- justify and explain the selection of the techniques you

    implemented, using relevant references and theories when necessary.

4.  4)  Experimental setup- explain the experimental setup and evaluation methods.

5.  5)  Results and Discussion- provide statistical and visual results, along with discussion on

    performance and outcomes

6.  6)  Conclusion- what worked and did not work, recommendations of future work

7.  7)  Contribution of Group Members – in this section you MUST present each group member’s

    contribution in brief. In maximum 3 lines per member, describe the component(s) that each

    group member contributed to.

8.  8)  References

**Group Project Logistics**

Due to the university’s guidelines to address COVID-19 outbreak, all communication for the group project MUST be maintained on the Microsoft Teams platform. Once the groups are formed, a tutor will be assigned to each group. The tutor will create a Team in Microsoft teams for each project group, then invite group members to it. The group can then maintain in the Team all the communication, code sharing, task planning and also the consultation sessions with the assigned tutor. Some useful apps you can install in your Microsoft Teams include:

1.  Github / Bitbucket for code sharing
2.  Asana / Trello for task planning
